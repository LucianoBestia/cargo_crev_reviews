# cargo_crev_reviews_micro_web_server_backend

This is a micro web server intended for local use with only one local browser connected to it.  
It is the backend of the application `cargo_crev_reviews`.  
The frontend is the GUI web app that runs in the browser and is connected only to this backend.  
Together the backend and the frontend form a complete application that is cross-platform.  
The server will operate on port <http://127.0.0.1:8182>.  
The initial URL will be: <http://127.0.0.1:8182/cargo_crev_reviews>
The code is from the [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-01-single-threaded.html)
and later from [github](https://github.com/steveklabnik/simple-server).
