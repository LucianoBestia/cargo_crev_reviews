  I've authored this and we've used it in production. We've had one overflow
  bug for a while, but we've not experienced any issues after fixing that one.
  
  We had multiple people look over it by now, and we've not found any more
  issues. The keys generated by this work fine with yggdrasil-go, and after
  fixing that one bug we've not experienced any incompatibilites anymore.
