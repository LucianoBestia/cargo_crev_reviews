# simple_server

This is a simple web server. I want to have the code here if I need to modify something or maybe make it more simple.  
The code is from the [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-01-single-threaded.html)
and later from [github.com/steveklabnik](https://github.com/steveklabnik/simple-server) the author of the book.
