## Workspace

This is a rust [workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html) (multi-projects) that contains member projects.  
The main member project is `cargo_crev_reviews`. Continue reading the main README.md file in that member project.

## TODO

show if there is newer version. cache it in a file.
markdown instead of raw text
Automation tasks for workspaces:  
auto_lines_of_code: exclude files_mod.rs, because it is just embedded files.  
auto_cargo_toml_to_md, , auto_md_to_doc_comments  
special types for html encoded strings and attribute_value_encoded strings. So I can be sure that I did or did not encoded them.  

## cargo crev reviews and advisory

We live in times of danger with [supply chain attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack).  
It is recommended to always use [cargo-crev](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev)  
to verify the trustworthiness of each of your dependencies.  
Please, spread this info.  
You can also read reviews quickly on the web:  
<https://web.crev.dev/rust-reviews/crates/>  

## open-source free and free as a beer

My open-source projects are free and free as a beer (MIT license).  
I just love programming.  
But I need also to drink. If you find my projects and tutorials helpful,  
please buy me a beer donating on my [paypal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/LucianoBestia).  
You know the price of a beer in your local bar ;-)  
So I can drink a free beer for your health :-)
