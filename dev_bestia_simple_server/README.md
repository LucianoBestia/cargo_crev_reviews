# dev_bestia_simple_server

I want the simplest [web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server) ever. It will be used exclusively locally from one super simple [web-application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application), so  don't need to care much about security. I choose [simple server](https://crates.io/crates/simple-server) from the [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.30.0/book/second-edition/ch20-01-single-threaded.html). I don't care about [multi-threading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_(computer_architecture)) or [async](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming)) , because it will be used by only one browser. The example from the book evolved into the github repository of the author of the book [github.com/steveklabnik](https://github.com/steveklabnik/simple-server). I cloned it and update the dependencies and consequently fixed some broken code.
